0. Requirements
 
 - C compiler (that supports C89)
 - make (does not have to be GNU)
 - optional: scripting language libs, see doc/lang.html

1. configure

 Run ./configure

 You may want to specify the prefix, e.g. --prefix=/usr

 ./configure will automatically detect and enable scripting with
 libs found on the system. There is no --with or --without arguments.
 If a language is not enabled, the lib is not found or is not suitable
 (check the version)

2. compile

 Run make

3. test

 At the moment there's no automated testing. The most common thing to
 test is scripts. For that, before installation:

 cd example
 SCRIPT=hello.fawk ./test_script

 The script name determines the language used. All script output shall be
 the same, except for the 'Set up' line that differs in language and file name.

4. installation

 Run make install

 For packaging, DESTDIR is supported.
