<h2> Details </h2>
<p>
Function calls from the script to C must be wrapped in calls to
local shell function fgw. For example, assuming there's a function
called atoi, instead of <i>atoi 4</i> the script needs to call
<i>fgw atoi 4</i>.
<p>
Because of the text protocol of the cli, all data passed between the
script and the C program are converted to string.
