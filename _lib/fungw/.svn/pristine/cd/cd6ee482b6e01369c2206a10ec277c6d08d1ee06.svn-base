<h3 id="api"> API hacks </h3>
<p>
Required major hacks because the perl API doesn't support storing caller
context. It is also impossible to register a perl variable for this purpose
between init and script load. The current solution is using an unused
field of the perl interpreter struct, which may not be the most stable
soltuion long term.

<h3 id="conf"> configuration </h3>
<p>
On Debian, ithread is enabled by default by the packaging. If you
compile perl from source, you probably need to enable it by hand. Readme.irix
suggests running Configure with -Duseithreads.
<p>
Karl's comments on enabling ithreads on gentoo:
<pre>
Doing the things below (in gentoo) makes that so:

  the magic, add ithreads support to perl:
# echo dev-lang/perl ithreads > /etc/portage/package.use/perl

  rebuilding perl (-aqv is not nessesary):
# emerge -aqv perl
[ebuild   R   ] dev-lang/perl-5.26.9999  USE="berkdb gdbm ithreads* -debug -doc" 
...

Here comes a warning that you must rebuild all things perl (not perl
itself which was rebuild above), which is done with the perl-cleaner
thing below.

  I got what was requested:
$ perl -V | grep PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT 
    PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT

  cleaning upp the mess:
# perl-cleaner --modules ; perl-cleaner --force --libperl
[ rebuilding 100+ packages...]

It seems that "ithreads" is per default off.
