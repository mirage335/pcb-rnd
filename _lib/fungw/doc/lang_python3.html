<b>Python3 is not recommended for scripting. </b>

<h2> Details </h2>
<p id="#api">
Python3 removed PyString but memory management breaks with PyUnicode so
fungw has to use PyBytes which is probably unconvenient.
<p>
Python3 takes over signal handling which is usually incompatible with the
application it is running in.
